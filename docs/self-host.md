# Self-hosting MeshVault

MeshVault is the model plus the application plus compute. That is the company, the offer, and the message.

The signed-in application is a long-running API, a Graphile Worker, Postgres, and a computer provider (Docker supervisor or E2B). The agent spine is Hermes Agent + Bot Mode (`AGENT_RUNTIME=hermes`). It is not a static site. The marketing site in `apps/www` can be hosted separately.

Desktop is Electron. Mobile is the existing Expo iOS app. License and provenance are recorded in `LICENSE`, `NOTICE`, and `UPSTREAM.md`.

## Local (source checkout)

Same as the README quick start: `.env` from `.env.example`, Postgres via Compose, `pnpm sandbox:build`, `pnpm dev`, then [http://127.0.0.1:5173](http://127.0.0.1:5173). Electron: `pnpm --filter @meshbot/desktop dev` while that stack is up.

## Docker Compose (single machine)

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` and `ENCRYPTION_KEY` to long random strings. MeshVault refuses placeholder or missing secrets outside `development` / `test` (or when `MESHBOT_ALLOW_DEV_SECRETS=1` is set).
2. Set `QWEN_API_KEY` or `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY` for the default Qwen path. Optional: `QWEN_BASE_URL` / `DASHSCOPE_BASE_URL` for a compatible OpenAI API. `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` still works. Deployment-owned local models use `MESHBOT_GATEWAY_URL`, `MESHBOT_GATEWAY_KEY`, and an exact `MESHBOT_GATEWAY_MODELS` list. Plugins use personal Composio sign-in and do not need a project API key.
3. Build the computer image: `pnpm sandbox:build` (Compose also builds it via the `computer` service).
4. `docker compose -f infra/compose/docker-compose.yml up --build`
5. Open the web origin (`http://127.0.0.1:5173` by default). The first registered user becomes the deployment owner.

Compose runs Postgres, the sandbox supervisor (Docker socket), API, worker, and a Vite preview of the web app. Bot computers are sibling containers (`meshbot/computer:local`). The API process does not get an unrestricted Docker socket; the supervisor owns lifecycle.

Postgres is published on **loopback only** (`127.0.0.1:5433` on the host). Do not expose that port on a public VPS. Change `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` and keep Postgres on an internal network when you deploy remotely.

The Docker supervisor is not published. It is authenticated and stays on the internal Compose network because access to it is equivalent to control of the Docker host. It uses `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` as its shared service credential by default; advanced deployments can set the same independent `SANDBOX_SUPERVISOR_TOKEN` value on the API, worker, and supervisor.

On a VPS, put TLS in front of `:5173` (or serve the web build behind your proxy) and set:

```env
BETTER_AUTH_URL=https://app.example.com
WEB_ORIGIN=https://app.example.com
API_URL=https://app.example.com
```

Cookies and CORS follow those origins. In production, `API_URL` must be browser-reachable HTTPS because it forms `/api/connections/composio/callback`. HTTP is accepted only in development or tests on `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, or `::1`. Keep `SIGNUPS_ENABLED` / `SIGNUP_ALLOWLIST` tight on a public host.

Optional:

```env
SIGNUPS_ENABLED=true
SIGNUP_ALLOWLIST=you@example.com,@company.com
SANDBOX_PROVIDER=docker   # or e2b. Keep fake only for pnpm verify:fast.
AGENT_RUNTIME=hermes      # Product spine. Use pi only for the pre-Hermes loop. Keep scripted only for pnpm verify:fast.
WAKEUP_DRIVER=graphile
SANDBOX_IDLE_MS=600000    # pause the bot computer after 10 minutes idle
E2B_API_KEY=              # when SANDBOX_PROVIDER=e2b
QWEN_API_KEY=             # or DASHSCOPE_API_KEY
QWEN_BASE_URL=            # optional; default DashScope international compatible-mode
MESHBOT_GATEWAY_URL=      # deployment-owned OpenAI-compatible model gateway
MESHBOT_GATEWAY_KEY=
MESHBOT_GATEWAY_MODELS=   # comma-separated model IDs actually served
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=       # still supported
```

Do not commit `.env`. Never put Qwen / DashScope keys, OpenRouter keys, Composio OAuth tokens, or provider tokens in git, logs, or chat.

## Choosing a computer provider

The Electron desktop app is a client of the same API. Docker and E2B still apply. On first launch, Electron asks the deployment owner whether bots should keep using Docker or run on this Mac as you. `SANDBOX_PROVIDER=desktop` is a separate, explicit provider that always runs commands on the service host.

- **Docker** is the default for local use and the quickest self-hosted setup. Each bot gets a container and persistent home. Keep the supervisor private, as the included Compose file does. A public single-machine Docker deployment still shares one Docker host between its bot containers.
- **E2B** runs bot computers away from the MeshVault host and is the recommended choice for public or multi-user production deployments.
- **Desktop provider** / **This Mac** runs commands on the API/worker host. Docker stays the default. The Electron app asks once; if you choose This Mac, bots can use working directories under your home folder. Do not enable it on a public or shared service. macOS does not show its own permission dialog for this.
- **Fake** is only an emulator for verification.

## Backup

```bash
./scripts/backup.sh
```

This dumps Postgres (`pg_dump`) and archives `data/` into `backups/<stamp>/`.

## Restore

```bash
./scripts/restore.sh backups/<stamp>
```

## Upgrade

Pull the new source, run `pnpm --filter @meshbot/db migrate`, then restart API and worker. Product contracts stay compatible across cloud and self-hosted.

## What “MeshVault Cloud” still needs

`apps/www` (Astro, `output: "static"`, `site: https://meshvault.ai`) can go live today on Vercel, Cloudflare Pages, or any static host. The waitlist link is `mailto:tanner@meshvault.ai`. That is the marketing site, not the product.

The product cannot be “pushed live” as a Vercel serverless app. Graphile Worker, Postgres `LISTEN`, Pi runs, and Docker computers need durable processes and a sandbox host.

To run a hosted product (same codebase):

1. Push `main` (this checkout may be ahead of GitHub).
2. Provision managed Postgres 16 and run `pnpm db:migrate`.
3. Run **API** and **worker** as always-on Node 22 services (Fly machines, a VM, ECS, k8s). Not lambda-style request handlers.
4. Persist `DATA_DIR` (bot homes, artifacts). Today that is a local filesystem (`LocalAgentHomeStore`), so attach a volume. Object-storage-backed homes are not wired yet.
5. Choose computers: **`SANDBOX_PROVIDER=e2b`** with `E2B_API_KEY` for a public or multi-user production service. Each bot keeps one sandbox id (`providerRef`) and a graphical desktop with a browser. Take control, sign in, then release — the bot keeps that session. Idle boxes pause after `SANDBOX_IDLE_MS` (default 10 minutes) and resume on the next message or Take control. Docker remains the local and trusted single-machine default.
6. A Hetzner CX22 (2 vCPU / 4 GB) is enough for API + worker + Postgres when E2B owns the desktops. 2 GB works for a quiet box; 8 GB is only needed if you also run Docker computers on that same machine.
7. Set public HTTPS `WEB_ORIGIN` / `BETTER_AUTH_URL` / `API_URL`, secrets, and a Qwen / DashScope (or OpenRouter / other Pi) deployment key if you want to skip per-user model keys.
8. Put the web app behind the same origin as `/api` and `/rpc` (Vite preview proxy, or a reverse proxy). Docker noVNC connections use short-lived signed `/novnc/*` capabilities; do not replace that route with an unrestricted port proxy.
9. Deploy `apps/www` to `meshvault.ai` and point `app.meshvault.ai` (or similar) at the product origin.
10. Turn on `SIGNUP_ALLOWLIST` until you want open registration. There is no MeshVault-managed model billing in version 1 — users bring keys.

Expo / desktop installers are clients of that origin (`EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL`, `MESHBOT_WEB_URL`). They are not a Cloud control plane.

The iOS app can also point at a self-hosted origin at runtime. On the sign-in screen, tap **Use a custom server** and enter the same HTTPS origin as `WEB_ORIGIN` (for example `https://app.example.com`). Store builds still default to `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL`; the in-app setting is an override for people running their own API. Changing the server signs the device out of any previous session.
